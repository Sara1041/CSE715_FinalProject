# CSE715_FinalProject
Unsupervised clustering of hybrid language music using VAE and baseline methods
This repository contains an unsupervised learning pipeline for clustering hybrid-language music tracks (Bangla and English, a customed dataset) using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and baseline clustering methods.

The project explores how learned latent representations from audio features compare against traditional feature-based and metadata-only baselines.
